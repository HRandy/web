		The marriage quickly turned sour, though, and a year later he fled to Sydney.
		There, while working as a bongo drummer in a nightclub, the man who would become known as the "Playboy Peer" met his second wife, Shirin Belly, a Malaysian belly dancer and fire-eater.
		They married in 1958, had a daughter, and enjoyed both a move to Ibiza and a belly-dancing tour of Europe during their nine years together.
		In 1965, Antony Moynihan - who once worked as chauffeur for notorious slum landlord Peter Rachman - entered the House of Lords, declaring: "I have every intention of shaking this place up. Sparks will fly."
		But his active days in the Lords were short-lived as, by 1970, he was facing dozens of fraud charges over various business and financial transactions.
		He would later say he had been given 48 hours' notice by a man from the CID who offered to make the charges go away for £50,000.
		Instead, he fled the country with his, by then third, wife Luz de la Rossa Fernandez, a dancer and the niece of the Philippines' ambassador to Cambodia.
		After a brief spell in Spain, during which British officials sought his extradition, the family landed in the Philippines where he remained for most of the rest of his life.
		Maria Aurora was born in 1971, a younger sister for the couple's first child Antonita, now a famous Filipino actress known as Maritoni Fernandez. A third sister Kathleen was born in 1974.
		After learning of her sister's death this week, Ms Fernandez described her as an "exceptional human being I will forever have the privilege of calling my sister".
