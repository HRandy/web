			Even after a long fashion month, I always manage to get a second wind the moment the Eurostar pulls into Gare Du Nord, but this season was especially exciting with so many new designers installed at the helms of houses -- Maria Grazia Chiuri at Dior and Anthony Vaccarello at Yves Saint Laurent, as well as Pierpaolo Piccioli's first solo outing for Valentino and Bouchra Jarrar's debut show at Lanvin.
			Here are a few of my most treasured memories from this season. I'll be going home filled to the brim with ideas for the new issue, and certainly can't wait to get my hands on some of those collections...
