						'Afghan Girl' in iconic National Geographic photo arrested in Pakistan

						Headlines can paint a pretty grim picture of life across our planet. On bad days, they can make any of us want to seek shelter at home. But in fact, doing the opposite can produce surprisingly curative results. Spin the globe. Pack a bag. Break bread with strangers. Soak in radical beauty. In short – travel.
						We asked a range of people, from writers and chefs to musicians and photographers, to share one experience from the last year that truly inspired them – something that, in no uncertain terms, reminded them why they love the world. Madly. Here's what they told us.
						Editor's note: aspects of the feature aren't supported in IE9 and earlier, or on iPads using Safari.
